        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Inpatient Hospital Data Analysis Summary</h1>

        <p>The analysis was conducted for the span from June 1, 2022 to May 31, 2023, which provided interesting and valuable insights from the year-long inpatient hospital data.</p>

        <h2>Highlights of Analysis</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For the period in examination, we had a total of 11,091 hospital admissions.</li>
            <li>The age group above 65 recorded the highest number of admissions (3340) followed closely by age groups 18 to 34, 35 to 49 and 50 to 64.</li>
            <li>Gender distribution was fairly even with males accounting for 5555 encounters and females 5536 encounters.</li>
            <li>Diabetes was the most prevalent medical condition followed closely by Arthritis and Cancer, all having slightly above 1800 cases.</li>
            <li>Most common admission type was Elective followed closely by Emergency and Urgent.</li>
            <li>Aspirin and Ibuprofen were the most common medications linked to hospital encounters.</li>
            <li>The dataset presented a well balanced spread across various insurance providers - Aetna, Blue Cross, Cigna, Medicare and UnitedHealthcare</li>
            <li>The total bill amount for the year-long period was $281,811,328.01</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Descriptive Analysis Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The average bill amount per encounter was $25409.01 with a marginal deviation in the median at $25379.57</li>
            <li>Diabetes condition showed the highest billing impact amounting to $48,305,610, followed closely by Arthritis and Cancer among others.</li>
            <li>Medication-wise, the total bill amount was highest for patients taking Ibuprofen followed closely by those on Aspirin and Lipitor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advanced Analytic Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Testing for higher medical costs for patients with abnormal or inconclusive test results revealed that Medicare patients presented a significant rise (5.01% deviation) in mean billing amount. However, the p-value (0.048637) indicated that this result was marginally statistically significant.</li>
            <li>Only weak correlation was established between age, billing amount and length of stay.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Forecasted Billing Amount</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Forecasts for the upcoming three months (July to September, 2023) predict a slight decrease in billing amount monthly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Areas of Attention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Further analysis can be conducted on the statistically significant higher spend by Medicare patients with abnormal test results to understand its causes and evaluate possible cost management strategies.</li>
            <li>Continued monitoring of billing amounts per encounter across various insurance providers, medications and medical conditions is necessary to highlight potential issues and opportunities for cost reduction.</li>
            <li>Understanding the weak correlation between age, billing amount and length of stay could guide admission strategies and resource allocation for better patient care and cost efficiency.</li>
